Hello! I'm a reliability engineer with a PhD in industrial engineering focusing on Optimal Reliability & Maintability Allocation. I'm a passionate learner always updating my theoretical knowledge to embrace my technical job with the latest and most up to date techniques. 

I'm also a father of three and enjoy running, swimming, and playing squash in my free time.
